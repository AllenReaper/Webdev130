            <h1>My story</h1>
            <p class="dastory">I have loved technology since I was a kid. 
            One of my passions is taking things apart and putting them back together. 
            I’ve built many computers, and have learned how to run many programs. 
            I love people and I’m passionate about teaching others how to use their computers and phones. 
            I hope this website and my skills are helpful to those that I am around.</p>
            
            <p class="dastory2">The Story: This whole idea started while I was working with customers 
                who would come into the store and ask for assistance on small and simple tasks with their technology. 
                I was pleasantly surprised with how often and how many people didn’t know the basics of how to use their phones.
                It blew my mind how many people didn’t even know how to turn off their phones.</p>

            <p class="dastory3">I kept thinking to myself wouldn’t it be nice if there was a place I could refer all these customers to, 
                to help them with simple tasks. That’s when the idea for a website occurred to me; 
                I was currently in a web development class learning how to build websites. What perfect timing, 
                I’m learning the skills to build the resource that I’m looking for. 
                After talking with a couple of customers about this idea, and getting a few reminders of things that old people are, 
                and are not capable of, I started to gather an idea of what I wanted the website to look like.</p>

            <p class="dastory4">After a few different iterations of the name, 
                and website I finally had a wireframe that I liked and that I could build off of, 
                What changed about the website and the idea was I wanted to provide videos for clients to watch 
                that go into detail on what and how to solve an issue or answer a question. 
                I wanted there to be a section that was similar to a manual that they could read from that is word-for-word, 
                step-by-step on how to use their technology. I also wanted to implement in-person classes that I can provide, 
                and answer any questions that they may have 
                because I also understand that it’s much easier to talk to someone person-to-person.
